# 40 FT Container – Usage Logic for Industrial Cargo

The 40 FT container offers higher volume than a 20 FT container,
but the same or similar payload limits.

For many products, misuse of 40 FT containers causes
overweight issues, damage, and hidden costs.

---

## Standard 40 FT Container Limits
- Max payload: ~26–28 MT (similar to 20 FT)
- Internal volume: ~67 CBM

Volume doubles, payload does not.

---

## Why 40 FT Is RISKY for Powders
Powder cargo reaches weight limits long before volume is filled.

Example:
- 25 kg powder bags
- 1,000 bags already reach ~25 MT
- Container is only half full by volume

This creates:
- Poor space utilization
- High center of gravity
- Risk of shifting during transit

---

## When 40 FT DOES Make Sense
Use 40 FT containers for:
- Light and bulky cargo
- Empty bags
- PP woven bags
- Plastic items
- Mixed cargo (heavy + light)
- Cartons and packaged goods

40 FT is ideal when volume is the constraint, not weight.

---

## 40 FT for Bag Exports (Key Advantage)
For exporting empty bags:
- Volume fills before weight
- 18,000–22,000 PP woven bags fit comfortably
- Excellent freight efficiency

This is where 40 FT shines.

---

## Mixed Cargo Strategy
40 FT containers work well when combining:
- Powder bags (partial load)
- Light items (bags, spacers, cartons)

This improves freight efficiency when planned carefully.

---

## Common Mistakes
- Using 40 FT for powders only
- Overloading weight limits unknowingly
- Poor load planning
- Ignoring axle load limits at destination

Many traders learn this only after penalties.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Use 40 FT containers only when:
- Volume is the limiting factor
- Cargo is light or mixed

For pure powder cargo, prefer 20 FT.
