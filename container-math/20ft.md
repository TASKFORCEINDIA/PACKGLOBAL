# 20 FT Container – Powder Packaging Logic

The 20 FT container is the preferred choice for exporting powdered
construction and industrial materials.

For powders, weight capacity is reached before volume capacity,
making the 20 FT container the most efficient option.

---

## Standard 20 FT Container Limits
- Max payload: ~26–28 MT (varies by line & route)
- Internal volume: ~33 CBM

Powder cargo typically hits weight limits first.

---

## Typical Powder Loading Example

### 25 kg Bags
- 1,000 bags × 25 kg = 25 MT
- Fits comfortably within payload
- Efficient floor loading or palletized loading

### 40 kg Bags
- 625 bags × 40 kg = 25 MT
- Fewer bags, faster unloading
- Requires stronger bags and careful stacking

---

## Why 20 FT Is Preferred
- Better weight-to-volume match
- Lower risk of overloading
- Easier port handling
- Faster loading and unloading
- Lower damage risk compared to tall stacks in 40 FT

---

## When NOT to Use 20 FT
Avoid 20 FT containers when:
- Cargo is very light and bulky
- Mixed cargo is planned
- Container availability is limited

In these cases, 40 FT may be used.

---

## Loading Best Practices
- Use container floor liner if moisture risk exists
- Stack bags in interlocking pattern
- Maintain even weight distribution
- Brace near container doors
- Avoid overfilling to prevent door bulging

---

## Common Mistakes
- Trying to exceed weight limits
- Mixing powder and light cargo improperly
- Ignoring axle load restrictions at destination
- Poor stacking leading to bag damage

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
For powder products:
Use 20 FT containers unless there is a strong logistical reason not to.
