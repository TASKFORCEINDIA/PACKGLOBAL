# Bale Compression – Container Profit Logic

Compression refers to how tightly empty bags are pressed and packed
into bales before loading into containers.

Compression directly determines how many bags fit in one container.
This is a major profit lever in bag exports.

---

## Why Compression Matters
- Freight is paid per container
- Revenue is earned per bag
- More bags per container = lower freight per bag

Two suppliers with the same bag price can have very different margins
based only on compression quality.

---

## Bale Basics
- Bags are packed into rectangular bales
- Bale size depends on:
  - Bag thickness
  - GSM
  - Lamination
  - Compression method

Smaller bale size = more bales per container.

---

## Typical Bale Counts

### Non-Laminated PP Woven Bags
- ~500 bags per bale (good compression)
- 40 FT container: ~40–45 bales
- Total: ~20,000–22,000 bags

---

### Laminated PP Woven Bags
- ~400–450 bags per bale
- Stiffer material reduces compression
- 40 FT container: ~38–42 bales
- Total: ~16,000–18,500 bags

---

## Compression Methods

### Manual Compression
- Lower compression
- Inconsistent bale size
- Lower bags per container

---

### Hydraulic Press Compression
- Higher compression
- Uniform bale size
- Higher container efficiency

Preferred for export-grade shipments.

---

## Compression vs Bag Damage
Over-compression can:
- Deform bags
- Crack lamination
- Create sharp folds

Balance is required between density and bag integrity.

---

## What to Confirm with Factory
Before quoting, always confirm:
- Bags per bale
- Bale dimensions
- Number of bales per container
- Compression method used

Never assume standard numbers.

---

## Common Mistakes
- Quoting based on assumed bag counts
- Ignoring lamination impact
- Allowing inconsistent bale sizes
- Accepting factory estimates without proof

These mistakes quietly destroy margins.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Profit is decided by:
Bags per container × Margin per bag

Always optimize compression before negotiating price.
