# Bag Fit Calculator – Decision Logic

The Bag Fit Calculator is a logical framework used to determine
how many bags fit into a container based on bag specifications
and compression behavior.

This is a planning tool, not a pricing tool.

---

## Inputs Required
To calculate bag fit accurately, the following inputs are required:

- Bag type (PP woven / laminated / BOPP)
- Bag size (width × height)
- GSM
- Lamination (yes / no)
- Bag weight (grams)
- Bags per bale
- Bale dimensions
- Container type (20 FT / 40 FT)

Without these inputs, estimates will be inaccurate.

---

## Step-by-Step Logic

### Step 1: Identify Container Type
- Use 20 FT for heavy powder cargo
- Use 40 FT for empty bags or light cargo

Container choice sets weight and volume limits.

---

### Step 2: Confirm Bag Compression
- Non-laminated bags compress more
- Laminated bags compress less
- Higher GSM reduces compression

Compression determines bags per bale.

---

### Step 3: Calculate Bags per Bale
Factory-provided number must be confirmed.

Typical reference:
- Non-laminated: ~500 bags/bale
- Laminated: ~400–450 bags/bale

Always verify with physical samples.

---

### Step 4: Calculate Bales per Container
Depends on:
- Bale dimensions
- Container internal volume
- Loading pattern

Typical reference (40 FT):
- 38–45 bales

---

### Step 5: Calculate Total Bags per Container
Total bags =
Bags per bale × Bales per container

This number drives freight cost per bag.

---

## Example Calculation

Example:
- Bag type: PP woven (non-laminated)
- Bag weight: 95 grams
- Bags per bale: 500
- Bales per container: 42
- Container: 40 FT

Total bags =
500 × 42 = 21,000 bags

---

## Output Interpretation
- Higher bag count = better freight efficiency
- Lower bag count = higher cost per bag
- Small differences multiply at scale

Even a 1,000-bag difference significantly affects margins.

---

## Common Errors
- Assuming standard bag counts
- Ignoring lamination stiffness
- Ignoring bale size variation
- Ignoring container door clearance

Estimates must be validated per shipment.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Never quote export prices until:
- Bag fit is confirmed
- Compression method is verified
- Container plan is finalized
