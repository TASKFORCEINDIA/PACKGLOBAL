# Gypsum Packaging – Export Use Case

Gypsum powder is a common construction material exported in large volumes.
Packaging must balance cost, handling strength, and moisture protection.

This use case defines standard export-ready bag specifications for gypsum.

---

## Product Characteristics
- Powder form
- Medium bulk density
- Non-hygroscopic
- Dusty during handling

Gypsum does not require high moisture protection but requires clean handling.

---

## Recommended Bag Type
- PP woven bag
- Non-laminated for dry conditions
- Laminated only if long sea transit or open storage is expected

---

## Standard Bag Specifications

### Capacity
- 25 kg (most common for export)
- 40 kg (used where labor cost is high)

---

### Size
- 25 kg: 45 × 75 cm or 50 × 75 cm
- 40 kg: 50 × 80 cm

Size selection depends on gypsum fineness and filling method.

---

### GSM
- Recommended: 75–85 GSM
- Lower GSM risks tearing during stacking
- Higher GSM increases cost without major benefit

---

### Stitching
- Double stitch bottom
- Double fold recommended for export
- Quality thread required to prevent seam failure

---

### Lamination
- Not required for dry, covered transport
- Single-side lamination optional for:
  - Long sea transit
  - Humid destinations
  - Open-yard storage

Avoid unnecessary lamination to reduce cost.

---

## Container Loading

### Preferred Container
- 20 FT container

### Typical Load
- 25 kg × 1,000 bags = 25 MT
- Volume and weight align efficiently

40 FT containers are used only for mixed cargo.

---

## Handling & Storage Notes
- Use inner liner in container if humidity risk exists
- Place desiccants during long transit
- Avoid rain exposure during loading
- Stack bags in interlocking pattern

---

## Common Mistakes
- Over-specifying GSM
- Laminating by default
- Using single stitch for export
- Ignoring container lining

These increase cost or risk without benefit.

---

## PACK Global Recommendation
For standard gypsum exports:
- 25 kg PP woven bag
- 75–85 GSM
- Double stitch, double fold
- No lamination unless conditions demand it

This specification balances cost, safety, and export reliability.
