# Lamination Guide – Woven Bags

Lamination is a thin plastic coating applied to PP woven fabric
to provide moisture resistance and improved surface finish.

Lamination should be used only when required by the product
or handling conditions.

---

## What Lamination Does
- Adds moisture protection
- Reduces dust leakage
- Improves printing quality
- Slightly increases bag strength

Lamination does NOT make a bag waterproof.
It only slows moisture ingress.

---

## When Lamination is REQUIRED
Use laminated bags for:
- Cement
- Fertilizers
- Chemicals
- Hygroscopic materials
- Long sea transit
- Open-yard storage

These products are sensitive to moisture or dust loss.

---

## When Lamination is NOT Needed
Avoid lamination for:
- Grains
- Gypsum (dry conditions)
- Salt (short transit)
- Minerals that do not absorb moisture

Unnecessary lamination increases cost without benefit.

---

## Types of Lamination

### Single-Side Lamination
- Lamination on outer surface only
- Most common option
- Cost-effective
- Adequate for most exports

Recommended for standard export use.

---

### Double-Side Lamination
- Lamination on both inner and outer surfaces
- Higher moisture resistance
- Higher cost
- Reduced breathability

Used only for highly sensitive products.

---

## Lamination Thickness (Micron)
- 12–15 micron: Light protection
- 18–22 micron: Standard export
- 25+ micron: Heavy-duty applications

Increasing micron increases cost and bag stiffness.

---

## Impact on Container Loading
- Laminated bags are stiffer
- Slightly fewer bags fit per container
- Bale compression is reduced

Always confirm bags-per-bale after lamination.

---

## Common Mistakes
- Laminating by default
- Using high micron without need
- Ignoring breathability requirements
- Assuming lamination = waterproof

Incorrect lamination increases cost and handling issues.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Use lamination only when:
- Product demands it
- Storage or transit conditions require it

If unsure, start with single-side lamination at standard micron.
