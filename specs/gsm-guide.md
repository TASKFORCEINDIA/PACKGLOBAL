# GSM Guide – Woven Packaging

GSM (Grams per Square Meter) defines the weight and strength of woven fabric.
It is the single most important parameter in bag specification.

Correct GSM selection balances cost, strength, and handling performance.

---

## What GSM Means
- Higher GSM = thicker fabric = higher strength
- Lower GSM = lighter fabric = lower cost

GSM does NOT indicate bag size.
It only indicates fabric weight.

---

## Standard GSM Ranges (Industry Practice)

### 60–70 GSM
- Light-duty applications
- Rice, wheat, maize
- Short-distance handling
- Minimal stacking

Cost-efficient but not suitable for rough handling.

---

### 75–85 GSM
- Medium-duty applications
- Gypsum powder
- Cement raw materials
- General construction materials

This is the most commonly exported GSM range.

---

### 90–100 GSM
- Heavy-duty applications
- Fertilizers
- Minerals and ores
- Rough handling environments

Preferred where bags are stacked high or moved multiple times.

---

## GSM vs Product Density
High-density products require higher GSM even at lower bag weights.

Example:
- 25 kg gypsum may work at 75 GSM
- 25 kg mineral powder may require 90 GSM

Always consider product density, not just bag weight.

---

## GSM vs Cost Impact
- Every 10 GSM increase raises bag cost
- Over-specifying GSM reduces competitiveness
- Under-specifying GSM causes bag failure

Correct GSM selection is critical for margin control.

---

## Common Mistakes
- Choosing GSM based only on price
- Using same GSM for all products
- Ignoring handling conditions
- Ignoring stacking height

GSM must match product + logistics, not just tradition.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Select the lowest GSM that safely handles:
- Product weight
- Product density
- Handling method
- Transport distance
