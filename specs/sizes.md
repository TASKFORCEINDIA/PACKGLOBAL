# Bag Size Standards – Woven Packaging

Bag size refers to the WIDTH × HEIGHT of the finished bag.
Correct sizing is critical for filling efficiency, stacking stability,
and container utilization.

Bag size is chosen based on:
- Product weight
- Product bulk density
- Filling method

---

## Standard Size Format
Sizes are expressed in centimeters (cm):

WIDTH × HEIGHT  
Example: 50 × 80 cm

Width determines filling ease.  
Height determines volume capacity.

## Common Industry Sizes

### 25 kg Bags
Typical sizes:
- 45 × 70 cm
- 45 × 75 cm
- 50 × 75 cm

Used for:
- Gypsum powder
- Cement additives
- Fertilizers
- Chemicals

---

### 40 kg Bags
Typical sizes:
- 50 × 80 cm
- 50 × 85 cm

Used for:
- Minerals
- Construction materials
- Bulk powders

---

### 50 kg Bags
Typical sizes:
- 50 × 85 cm
- 55 × 90 cm
- 60 × 90 cm

Used for:
- Fertilizers
- Grains
- Salt
- Sugar

---

## Product Density Consideration
Products with higher bulk density require larger bags for the same weight.

Example:
- 50 kg grain fits in 50 × 85 cm
- 50 kg gypsum may require 55 × 90 cm

Never choose size based only on weight.

## Filling & Handling Notes
- Manual filling prefers wider openings
- Machine filling requires consistent width
- Overfilled bags reduce stack stability
- Underfilled bags waste container volume

Correct sizing improves:
- Stacking
- Transport efficiency
- Bag appearance

---

## Common Mistakes
- Using one size for all products
- Ignoring bulk density
- Overfilling to meet weight
- Changing size without changing GSM

Bag size and GSM must be selected together.

---

## Practical Rule (PACK Global)
Select the smallest bag size that:
- Fits product weight comfortably
- Allows clean filling
- Maintains stack stability
